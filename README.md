# Horiseon

## Description
- For this task, I used code refactoring to clean up the site using semantic HTML elements in the index.html section, which makes the website easier to read. I used alt descriptors on the image elements to describe what was going on in the images. In CSS there were a lot of selectors that were unnecesarily by themselves, so I consolidated and organized them to follow semantic structure.
